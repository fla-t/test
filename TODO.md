BEFORE SERVICE WORK STARTS, I NEED TO MAKE THE DB AND ALL THE INFRA LAYER WORKING SMOOTHLY

1. Dockerfile
2. Docker-compose config
3. Database migrations using alembic

Then:

4. First make product service and a CRUD for it (product registration)
5. Next then make a inventory service (CRUD for the inventory)
6. Next then make a sale service that tracks each product sale (fake data here!)
7. Make service functions that do everything.
